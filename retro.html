    <p>This website was created in 2021, but I still made a retro page anyway. This is for my 1999 Bondi Blue iMac G3! Just know: I don't discriminate against a computer because of its age. All computers matter!</p>

    <p> I love using a Macintosh. My favourite games are Doom & Quake. The graphics are amazing!</p>
