<h1> My favourite Classic Macs! </h1>
<br>
<p> Hey guys! Here are some of the macs I really want or already have, ranked by how much I want them. (These are classic  macs only) </p>
<br>
<h2> 1. iMac G3 </h2>
<p> I have this Mac and LOVE IT! It's a fantastic retro machine that feels great to use and I love it. The internet on here is wonderful. I can google pretty much anything and the result will load. Plus, I relived my childhood on this computer by installing some old games I used to play and running them on real hardware </p>
<h2> 2. iBook G3 </h2>
<p> I really would like an iMac in portable format. I love CRT monitors for when I am home but a portable G3 machine would be awesome. Especially blueberry to match my iMac. </p>
<h2>3. Matte black plastic powerbook (5300cs) </h2>
<p> This powerbook would be really awesome to take to school, and I personally would love to play the classic mac sounds in class in front of everyone while they are shocked at how I am using such old technology. </p>
<h2>4. iPod (2001) </h2>
<p> While not a Macintosh computer, I would love an iPod with a bluetooth mod so I can listen to my music on a standalone device without ads, and I don't have to store it on my iPhone. I can store so much music on an iPod! </p>
<h2>5. Power Mac G4 Cube</h2>
<p> Rare Mac computer, and it would be really nice to have a G4 computer that I can use to run Mac OS X 10.0 - 10.4 on. It's compact and the cinema display is decent. </p>
