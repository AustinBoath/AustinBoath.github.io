<h1> I'm Scally! </h1>
<p> I am building this site on a Macintosh right now, and it is surprisingly fun to get myself a place on-line! </p> 
<br>
<h2> So, here's a bit about me: </h2> 
<br>
<p> I love to play DOOM & Quake! The graphics are amazing! So far, I can play the first 3 levels REALLY, REALLY fast but I'm yet to beat e1m1 in nightmare mode. </p>
<br>
<p>I also have a notorious history of being addicted to Super Mario World for the SNES.</p>
<br>
<p> My computer of choice is the iMac G3, as it is so simple to get online </p>
