            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hey there, I’m Austin Boath, from Adelaide, South Australia, just figuring out the world one step at a time. This site? It’s my little hub now—a place to host projects, random creations, and whatever else pops into my head. Funny thing is, I didn’t always have a website. I grabbed the domain years back just for a backup email address, something redundant in case life got messy. But then I thought, why not make something of it? So here we are.
I built this with plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript, keeping it lean and simple, like a throwback to the late ‘90s or early 2000s. This means you can literally load this site on a Windows 3.1 or 95 PC (I’ve tried and it works). No fancy frameworks, no bloat, just the essentials. I’m a minimalist at heart; I believe in getting it done without the fuss. Think of it as a digital campfire: small, warm, and straight to the point.
Growing up, my family showed me what hard work and standing on your own looks like, and I’ve been chasing that ever since, whether it’s picking up a new skill or spotting beauty in the quiet moments. I love tinkering with stuff. I mess around with content creation, little stories about travel, fitness, or wandering through cities.
Life’s all about movement for me. I’m hooked on cycling, grinding through those uphill slogs where my legs complain but I push on anyway. Running, hiking, kayaking, fishing, it’s my way of catching a breath and soaking in what’s out there. I camp too, keeping it low-key and leaving no trace. Sometimes I’ll sketch a town map on paper just because it’s fun. Geography, logistics, nature, they’re like puzzle pieces of the world.
I’ve got ideas about making things better: less taxation, more room to roam and speak freely; but really, I just want to live in a way that feels true. Looking ahead, I’d love to fly planes someday, settle down in a rural spot with a family, and keep sharing snippets of my journey online.
This site’s where I’ll drop those snippets—projects, thoughts, whatever’s cooking. It’s rough around the edges, but that’s how I like it. Poke around, and if something clicks with you, I’d love to hear about it!
