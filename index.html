            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hey there, I’m Austin Boath, from Adelaide, South Australia, just figuring out the world one step at a time. This site? It’s my little hub now—a place to host projects, random creations, and whatever else pops into my head.
            <br>
                Funny thing is, I didn’t always have a website. I grabbed the domain years back just for a backup email address, something redundant in case life got messy. But then I thought, why not make something of it? So here we are.
I built this with plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript, keeping it lean and simple, like a throwback to the late ‘90s or early 2000s. This means you can literally load this site on a Windows 3.1 or 95 PC (I’ve tried and it works). No fancy frameworks, no bloat, just the essentials. I’m a minimalist at heart; I believe in getting it done without the fuss. Think of it as a digital campfire: small, warm, and straight to the point.
<br>
Growing up, my family showed me what hard work and standing on your own looks like, and I’ve been chasing that ever since, whether it’s picking up a new skill or spotting beauty in the quiet moments. I love tinkering with stuff. I mess around with content creation, little stories about travel, fitness, or wandering through cities.
<br> Life’s all about movement for me. I’m hooked on cycling, grinding through those uphill slogs where my legs complain but I push on anyway. Running, hiking, kayaking, fishing, it’s my way of catching a breath and soaking in what’s out there. I camp too, keeping it low-key and leaving no trace. Sometimes I’ll sketch a town map on paper just because it’s fun. Geography, logistics, nature, they’re like puzzle pieces of the world.
<br>I’ve got ideas about making things better: less taxation, more room to roam and speak freely; but really, I just want to live in a way that feels true. Looking ahead, I’d love to fly planes someday, settle down in a rural spot with a family, and keep sharing snippets of my journey online.
<br>This site’s where I’ll drop those snippets—projects, thoughts, whatever’s cooking. It’s rough around the edges, but that’s how I like it. Poke around, and if something clicks with you, I’d love to hear about it!
